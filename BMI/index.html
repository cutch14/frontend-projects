            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
            body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
            determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point
            to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
              Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
              experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
              diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
              content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
              strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes
              daily for five days a week.

            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.

            The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with
